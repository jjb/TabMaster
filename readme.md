# TabMaster

![Poster for the 1982 move "The Beastmaster", with humourous modifications. The original poster has a hercules-style hero raising a sword above his head. His beast companions — a tiger, a large bird of prey, and 2 marmots or something — surround him. A scantily-clad damsel in distress crouches at his side. There are two modifications. First, browser tabs for GitHub, Trello, and Medstro are pasted over the animals. Second, there is a laptop placed in the lap of the woman.](https://raw.github.com/jjb/TabMaster/master/poster.jpg "The TabMaster")


## Problems

If you have a browser window in the dock and/or a browser window fullscreened in another Space/Desktop, and you click a link in another application, Safari or Chrome will either bring a window out of the dock and open the tab there, or silently and secretly open the tab in a window in another Space/Desktop.

***WHYYYYYYYYY???!!!!!?!?!***

Well, this fixes that.

## How To Use

1. Put TabMaster.app in /Applications
2. Double click it to start it. You won't see anything happen.
3. Go to System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items and set it to start at login
2. Open Safari and set TabMaster to be the default web browser

## How to compile yourself (which is necessary if you use Chrome)

1. Open TabMaster.scpt in AppleScript Editor.app
2. Look at it, modify it. It's self-explanatory
3. Save as an application in /Applications
4. GOTO *How To Use*


Inspiration for the AppleScript code came from: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20091013114424722
